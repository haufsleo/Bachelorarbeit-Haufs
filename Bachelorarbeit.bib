abstract = {Observation of surgical procedures performed by experts is extremely important for acquisition and improvement of surgical skills. Smart glasses are small computers, which comprise a head-mounted monitor and video camera, and can be connected to the internet. They can be used for remote observation of surgeries by video streaming. Although Google Glass is the most commonly used smart glasses for medical purposes, it is still unavailable commercially and has some limitations. This article reports the use of a different type of smart glasses, InfoLinker, for surgical video streaming. InfoLinker has been commercially available in Japan for industrial purposes for more than 2 years. It is connected to a video server via wireless internet directly, and streaming video can be seen anywhere an internet connection is available. We have attempted live video streaming of knee arthroplasty operations that were viewed at several different locations, including foreign countries, on a common web browser. Although the q...},

abstract = {Since the launch of Google Glass in 2014, smart glasses have mainly been designed to support micro-interactions. The ultimate goal for them to become an augmented reality interface has not yet been attained due to an encumbrance of controls. Augmented reality involves superimposing interactive computer graphics images onto physical objects in the real world. This survey reviews current research issues in the area of human computer interaction for smart glasses. The survey first studies the smart glasses available in the market and afterwards investigates the interaction methods proposed in the wide body of literature. The interaction methods can be classified into hand-held, touch, and touchless input. This paper mainly focuses on the touch and touchless input. Touch input can be further divided into on-device and on-body, while touchless input can be classified into hands-free and freehand. Next, we summarize the existing research efforts and trends, in which touch and touchless input are evaluated by a total of eight interaction goals. Finally, we discuss several key design challenges and the possibility of multi-modal input for smart glasses.},

abstract = {As technology is growing rapidly and integrating itself to all aspects of people's life, designers and developers try to provide a more pleasant experience of technology to people. One of the technology trends which aims to make life easier is wearable computing. Wearables aim to assist people to be in control of their life by augmenting the real life with extra information constantly and ubiquitously. One of the growing trends of wearable computing is Head Mounted Displays (HMD), as the head is a great gateway to receive audio, visual and haptic information. Also due to the Google Glass project, wearables in form of glasses gained much more attention during last years. However, because of the early stages of the technology adaptation, there is still much to explore on social acceptancy, key use cases and design directions of glasses as a type of wearable computing. This thesis has two stages. In the first stage, the aim is to explore the different use cases of a wearable eye tracker concept in different context and study the user's perception of such a device. To accomplish this objective a user study with (n=12) participants were conducted using the experience sampling methods (ESM) and employing a mock-up of a smart-glasses as a design probe. In the second stage the focus is to design different alternatives for a wearable eye tracker concept and evaluate the concepts by conducting focus groups (n=14) to understand the user perceptions toward different industrial design concepts of such a system.},

@misc{Tidwell2005,
abstract = {Designing a good interface isn't easy. Users demand software that is well-behaved, good-looking, and easy to use. Your clients or managers demand originality and a short time to market. Your UI technology - Web applications, desktop software, even mobile devices - may give you the tools you need, but little guidance on how to use them well. UI designers over the years have refined the art of interface design, evolving many best practices and reusable ideas. If you learn these, and understand why the best user interfaces work so well, you too can design engaging and usable interfaces with less guesswork and more confidence. Designing Interfaces captures those best practices as design patterns - solutions to common design problems, tailored to the situation at hand. Each pattern contains practical advice that you can put to use immediately, plus a variety of examples illustrated in full color. You'll get recommendations, design alternatives, and warnings on when not to use them. Each chapter's introduction describes key design concepts that are often misunderstood, such as affordances, visual hierarchy, navigational distance, and the use of color. These give you a deeper understanding of why the patterns work, and how to apply them with more insight. A book can't design an interface for you - no foolproof design process is given here - but Designing Interfaces does give you concrete ideas that you can mix and recombine as you see fit. Experienced designers can use it as a sourcebook of ideas. Novice designers will find a roadmap to the world of interface and interaction design, with enough guidance to start using these patterns immediately.},

abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) has recently become a worldwide research topic. AR technology renders intuitive computer-generated contents on users' physical surroundings. To improve process efficiency and productivity, researchers and developers have paid increasing attention to AR applications in engineering analysis and simulation. The integration of AR with numerical simulation, such as the finite element method, provides a cognitive and scientific way for users to analyze practical problems. By incorporating scientific visualization technologies, an AR-based system superimposes engineering analysis and simulation results directly on real-world objects. Engineering analysis and simulation involving diverse types of data are normally processed using specific computer software. Correct and effective visualization of these data using an AR platform can reduce the misinterpretation in spatial and logical aspects. Moreover, tracking performance of the AR platforms in engineering analysis and simulation is crucial as it influences the overall user experience. The operating environment of the AR platforms requires robust tracking performance to deliver stable and accurate information to the users. In addition, over the past several decades, AR has undergone a transition from desktop to mobile computing. The portability and propagation of mobile platforms has provided engineers with convenient access to relevant information in situ. However, on-site working environment imposes constraints on the development of mobile AR-based systems. This paper aims to provide a systematic overview of AR in engineering analysis and simulation. The visualization, tracking techniques as well as the implementation on mobile platforms are discussed. Each technique is analyzed with respect to its pros and cons, as well its suitability to particular types of applications.},

@article{Redmon2015,
abstract = {We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.},

abstract = {Characteristics of head-mounted displays (HMDs) and their effects on simul ator sickness (SS) and presence were investigated. Update delay and wide field of views (FOV) have often been thought to elicit SS. With the exception of Draper et al. (2001), previous research that has examined FOV has failed to consider image scale fa ctor, or the ratio between physical FOV of the HMD display and the geometric field of vi ew (GFOV) of the virtual environment (VE). The current study investigated update delay, image scale factor, and peripheral vision on SS and presence when viewing a real-world scene. Participants donned an HMD and performed active head movements to search for objects located throughout the laboratory. Seven out of the first 28 participants withdrew from the study due to extreme responses. These participants experienced faint-li ke symptoms, confusion, ataxia, nausea, and tunnel vision. Thereafter, the use of a hand-rail was implemented to provide participants something to grasp while performing the experimental task. The 2X2X2 ANOVA revealed a main effect of peripheral vision, F (1,72) = 6.90, p = .01, indicating peak Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) scores were significantly higher when peripheral vision was occluded than when peripher al vision was included. No main effects or interaction effects were revealed o n Presence Questionnaire (PQ version 4.0) scores. However, a significant negative co rrelation of peak SSQ scores and PQ scores, r(77) = -.28, p = .013 was revealed. Participants also were placed into ‘sick' and ‘not-sick' groups based on a median split of SSQ scores. A chi-square analysis revealed that participants who were exposed to an additi onal update delay of {\~{}}200 ms were significantly more likely to be in the ‘sick' group than those who iii were exposed to no additional update delay. To reduce the occurrence of SS, a degree of peripheral vision of the external world should be included and attempts to reduce update delay should continue. Furthermore, participants should be provided with something to grasp while in an HMD VE. Future studies should seek to investigate a critical a mount of peripheral vision and update delay necessary to elicit SS.},

abstract = {In recent years, several interesting wearable products which originates from smartphone technology have been introduced on the market. One of these products which has increased in interest, but not yet received a commercial breakthrough, is smart glasses. As the technology is still young and undeveloped, few players have embarked on the market and there is still room for improvement. In this thesis, a specific usage area for smart glasses is explored: namely warehousing. This thesis is focused on the manual pick in a warehouse and how a user can confirm this pick. There are several different tools to help a user with this; confirming on a piece of paper, scan a barcode and voice recognition solutions. Consafe Logistics has developed a voice controlled solution which can be operated hands-free, which makes it possible for a user to use their hands exclusively for handling the pick. With Consafe's solution, the work was about twice as fast as when using a scanner to confirm a pick. This thesis will examine if the efficiency can be improved further by using smart glasses and if commercial use of smart glasses could have a future in warehousing. A major goal for this thesis was to investigate how to design an interface for smart glasses in order to make a product as usable as possible. Information on how to design an interface for smart glasses is scarce and in order to design a user friendly product, a user centered design process is employed. This thesis resulted in a proof of concept application which showed a tendency that the work proceeded faster and that the user was more confident in their work.},

For example, users can choose to place a virtual clock on their wall instead of the real physical object. We argue that being able to have fewer physical devices and products by replacing these objects with holograms offers multiple utilitarian and hedonic benefits. More specifically, we postulate that Perceived Substitutability, the extent to which a person believes that ARSG are able to substitute his/her real-life objects with virtual ones, is a positive influence factor of both Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Enjoyment, thus indirectly influencing ARSG usage. After collecting 109 questionnaires about Microsoft HoloLens and applying a SEM approach, our research model is confirmed, suggesting that manufacturers need to emphasize the utilitarian and hedonic benefits of their ARSG as well as promote their device's capability of substituting physical objects.},

@article{Wei2018,
abstract = {BACKGROUND In recent years, wearable devices have become increasingly attractive and the health care industry has been especially drawn to Google Glass because of its ability to serve as a head-mounted wearable device. The use of Google Glass in surgical settings is of particular interest due to the hands-free device potential to streamline workflow and maintain sterile conditions in an operating room environment. OBJECTIVE The aim is to conduct a systematic evaluation of the literature on the feasibility and acceptability of using Google Glass in surgical settings and to assess the potential benefits and limitations of its application. METHODS The literature was searched for articles published between January 2013 and May 2017. The search included the following databases: PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO (EBSCO), and IEEE Xplore. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and assessed full-text articles. Original research articles that evaluated the feasibility, usability, or acceptability of using Google Glass in surgical settings were included. This review was completed following the Preferred Reporting Results of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. RESULTS Of the 520 records obtained, 31 met all predefined criteria and were included in this review. Google Glass was used in various surgical specialties. Most studies were in the United States (23/31, 74{\%}) and all were conducted in hospital settings: 29 in adult hospitals (29/31, 94{\%}) and two in children's hospitals (2/31, 7{\%}). Sample sizes of participants who wore Google Glass ranged from 1 to 40. Of the 31 studies, 25 (81{\%}) were conducted under real-time conditions or actual clinical care settings, whereas the other six (19{\%}) were conducted under simulated environment. Twenty-six studies were pilot or feasibility studies (84{\%}), three were case studies (10{\%}), and two were randomized controlled trials (6{\%}). The majority of studies examined the potential use of Google Glass as an intraoperative intervention (27/31, 87{\%}), whereas others observed its potential use in preoperative (4/31, 13{\%}) and postoperative settings (5/31, 16{\%}). Google Glass was utilized as a videography and photography device (21/31, 68{\%}), a vital sign monitor (6/31, 19{\%}), a surgical navigation display (5/31, 16{\%}), and as a videoconferencing tool to communicate with remote surgeons intraoperatively (5/31, 16{\%}). Most studies reported moderate or high acceptability of using Google Glass in surgical settings. The main reported limitations of using Google Glass utilization were short battery life (8/31, 26{\%}) and difficulty with hands-free features (5/31, 16{\%}). CONCLUSIONS There are promising feasibility and usability data of using Google Glass in surgical settings with particular benefits for surgical education and training. Despite existing technical limitations, Google Glass was generally well received and several studies in surgical settings acknowledged its potential for training, consultation, patient monitoring, and audiovisual recording.},

abstract = {With hundreds of thousands of mobile apps available today, your app needs to capture a user's interest within minutesand sometimes even sooner. This practical guide teaches you the core principles for designing effective mobile user interfaces, and helps you get started by providing more than 40 proven UI patterns for mobile websites and applications. You'll find patterns for using gesture and sound, patterns that apply to touch and scroll-and-select devices, and some patterns that have different implementations to fit different interaction methods. Learn which patterns apply to the situation or problem youre trying to solve. In several cases, you'll discover more than one choice. Rather than attempt to repackage a web UI for a small screen, you need to take a completely different approach. Designing Mobile Interfaces shows you how.},

Bisher sind diese Technologien wenig erforscht und werden nur experimentell hinsichtlich einzelner Aspekte untersucht. Zur Priorisierung zuk{\"{u}}nftiger Forschungsthemen und Identifikation relevanter Problemstellungen f{\"{u}}r den Bereich der Wirtschaftsinformatik wurden daher explorative Fallstudien mit zwei Logistikdienstleistern durchgef{\"{u}}hrt. Zur Ermittlung relevanter Einsatzszenarien wurde eine Triangulation aus Experteninterviews, Beobachtungen und Fokusgruppen gew{\"{a}}hlt und durch eine systematische Literaturrecherche erg{\"{a}}nzt. Die 36 resultierenden Anwendungsf{\"{a}}lle wurden mithilfe einer Umfrage priorisiert und auf Basis ihrer qualitativen Aussagen bzgl. der Herausforderungen analysiert. Die Ergebnisse des Beitrags sind (1) Einsatzszenarien f{\"{u}}r Smart Glasses in der Logistik sowie (2) daraus abgeleitete Forschungsthemen f{\"{u}}r die Wirtschaftsinformatik. Somit leistet diese Studie einen Beitrag zur Forschung im Bereich des ganzheitlichen Designs von Dienstleistungssystemen und zuk{\"{u}}nftiger Aufgaben digitaler Arbeit.},

@incollection{Broll2013,
abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},
